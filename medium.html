    <h1>ASSESMENT REPORT</h1>
    <hr>
    <p id="lead">A Report by NeuroNurture based on the Research paper by various specialists and psychologists. (e.g. David R. Moore).</p>
    <div class="topic">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To assess the individual's auditory processing abilities through a comprehensive questionnaire, targeting various aspects such as discriminating between similar sounds or words.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Administered a questionnaire consisting of 13 items related to auditory processing skills.</li>
        <li>Scored responses based on the number of "Yes" answers.</li>
        <li>Categorized results into risk levels.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
    <H2>Summary</H2>
    <p>The individual has exhibited some challenges in auditory processing tasks, with less than 7 "Yes" responses. While not highly pronounced, there are areas, such as discriminating between similar sounds or words, that may require attention. The overall risk for Auditory Processing Disorder is moderate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="topic">
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Further observation and documentation of specific situations where challenges arise.</li>
        <li>Consider targeted interventions or strategies to address identified difficulties.</li>
        <li>A follow-up assessment may be beneficial to track progress and make necessary adjustments.</li>
