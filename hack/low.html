    <h1>ASSESMENT REPORT</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A Report by NeuroNurture based on the Research paper by various specialists and psychologists. (e.g. David R. Moore).</p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To assess the individual's auditory processing abilities based on a questionnaire focusing on various aspects, including following verbal instructions, understanding speech in noisy environments, and engaging in conversations.</p>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Administered a questionnaire consisting of 13 items related to auditory processing skills.</li>
        <li>Scored responses based on the number of "Yes" answers.</li>
        <li>Categorized results into risk levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <H2>Summary</H2>
    <p>The individual has exhibited minimal difficulties in the assessed areas related to auditory processing. With less than 3 "Yes" responses, there is a low risk of Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). The individual's ability to follow verbal instructions, understand speech in noisy environments, and engage in conversations appears to be within typical ranges.</p>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Continue monitoring for any emerging challenges.</li>
        <li>Encourage the individual to communicate openly about any difficulties they may experience.</li>
        <li>No immediate need for specialized intervention, but periodic assessments may be beneficial.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="precaution">*This is just a preliminary assessment report based on your responses in the questionnaire. Consider the fact that the symptoms can sometimes go unnoticed and if you feel there is some issue, you should get it checked by a proffessional.</p>
